IndyMill is an open source DIY CNC machine that is mostly (and hopefully soon will be completely) made out of metal. It was designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind! 
Designed by [Nikodem Bartnik](https://www.youtube.com/nikodembartnik). 

Here are just some of the features of this machine:

  - Aluminium profiles (2080 and 2040)
  - Compatible with Nema17 and Nema23 on X and Y axis (without redesgning a plate Z axis is only compatible with Nema23)
  - Made with ball screws, linear rails and 6mm steel plates to ensure rigidity
  - Can be easily scaled up if you need to, you just need to use longer profiles, ballscrews and linear rails

## Open Source
This machine is open source so above you can find all of the files that you need to build it. You can also check out videos below to see the build process. As for now machine was tested with various kinds of wood, MDF, acrylic and Aluminium. It is able to machine all of those materials even with small 500W spindle.
You can also find more information on my website: [Indystry.cc](https://indystry.cc/indymill/)




## Parts

You can find parts list in PDF or XLSX above but you can also find it here:
  - At [indystry.cc/indymill](https://indystry.cc/indymill) you can find a full table with all needed parts
  - [Google Drive Parts List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19kC1wDViL0N2BjQgnNMfYSCzLNLKAHwQCY5Ngf8wU5I) here you can find an online parts list 
  - You can buy some of the parts in my store

## Store
If you would like to support this project and my future projects you may consider buying parts for IndyMill from my store: [Indystry Store](https://indystry.cc/store/)
I am selling here steel plates (perfectly cut with a laser out of 6mm steel (Z axis rails are cut out of 8mm steel)), kit of screws and bearings, IndyShield and a buid instruction PDF.

## Build Instruction
This project is open source so you can find all the files that you need to build it above for free. You can easily build it just by taking a look at some images on my website and my videos.
But if you would like to get a PDF instruction that simplifies the build process, you can easily print it put it on a smartphone or computer, you can get one through link below and at the same time support my projects! You don't need it but it may help a little :)
