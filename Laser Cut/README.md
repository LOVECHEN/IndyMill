# Laser Cut

These plates can easily be laser cut from steel or aluminium. Steel is  a prefered material as it is stronger and usually cheaper to laser cut. You must shop around for the best price in your country. Also make sure that they are able to cut small holes with a laser, some companies say it's impossible but with a good laser it is easily doable. 
You can also make them on your own with a CNC machine or any other way you want, if you need dimensions just import DXF files to your CAD software and measure whatever you need.
You can also buy the plates in my [store](https://indystry.cc/store/).

DXF files are in `mm`.

Sometimes people ask me if it is possible to make those plates with different material than metal. It should be possible with thick plywood but obviously machine is not going to be that rigid. 3D printing those plates is most likely not a good idea.
Keep in mind I never tried making those plates out of wood or 3D printing.

Thanks to nice plates images and table to @carlpaton
